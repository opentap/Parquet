# Parquet
This is a package for OpenTAP and features a way to read and write parquet results to the OpenTAP engine.

For further documentation see the [docs](doc/readme.md)

## Installation
Write `tap package install Parquet` to install the newest release of the Parquet plugin.
If you are using OpenTAP in a runner it might already be installed if you are using the latest version.

To see documentation of the result listener you can see [here](./doc/result_listener.md).

There are plans to make a result store so result data can be read and showcased in KS8400, but currently that does not exist.

## Contributing
Any contributions are welcome. If you want to fix something simply fork the repo and create a pull request, you can also open an issue if you don't feel comfortable editing the code. Although your issue might not be prioritised.
